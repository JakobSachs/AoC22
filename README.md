# AoC22
My solutions for advent of code 22 in both C++ and Haskell.

# Building

### C++

For the C++ program , to run day N, just `cd` into the `src/cpp/` directory and run:

```
make
./dayN
```

### Haskell

I personally use Haskell-Stack for building, so install that on your machine before trying to build anything _(Though you might get away with just using the `.cabal`-file on its own)._

Then its just a matter of running:

```
stack run dayN
```
